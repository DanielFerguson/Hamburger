# Hamburger

Finally; an answer to the age-old question,
> "What're we having for dinner tonight?" - Everyone

## About the Project

I've been inspired with the Flutter framework, and have wanted to bring some of the ideas I've had over the past few years to life. Moreso to help stretch my development muscles.

For this project, I just wanted to create a simple app that I'd use in my day-to-day life. Nothing revolutionary, but something that helps me finally create a list of awesome recipes that I can reference time and time again.

The basic functionality includes...
- Find delicious recipes
- Get random recommendations for meals
- Keep a record of favourite recipes
- Able to step through the process of making the meals

## Design

I wanted this app to be fairly simple - looking at the Material Design guidelines from Google and Flutter.
